			<h3> User Interviews </h3>
			<p> During user interview, I have insights into the requirements, business and user value. By asking users some specific questions about what they want to see on the portfolio website, 
				I can know users’ expectations and what feature I should implement in the website. </p>

			<h3> Competitor Analysis </h3>
			<p> Competitors are those websites offering user to build their portfolio website by using their template like Linkedin. The goal of doing competitor analysis 
				is looking into what others do, how they do it, so that I can learn and improve my own portfolio website. My competitors are also the portfolio website 
				build by different designer. This process is important because I can learn from their strength and weakness. </p>

			<h3> Feature Value Matrix </h3>
			<p> It is used to organize feature lists base off their business value, user value, and technical effort. The feature having lowest business and user value 
				has highest priority of implementation to accomplishing user objectives. On contrast, the lower the number of technical effort is, the less amount of 
				effort needed for building a product. Doing a feature value matrix helps me sum up all interesting and useful features needed for the implementation.  </p>

			<h3> Feature Prioritization </h3>
			<p> It is used to decide which features have a most priority base on their matrix value. Features with lower total scores have higher priority. They require minimal efforts, 
				but they deliver high user and business value. From left to right, I ordered my feature list from lowest priority to highest priority. The feature which has the lowest 
				total score is the one I need to build first. </p>

			<h3> User Stories </h3>
			<p> It is high level definition of a requirement. It like the conversations between a developer and an end-user. It captures a description of a software feature. 
				The user stories can be used to give the development team a better ideas on target customer who will use that feature and why they use it, so that a developer 
				can gain insights into user experiences. </p>

			<h3> Cognitive Walkthrough </h3>
			<p> It is the process of sitting next to the users and walk them through the entire interface. I asked them some questions to complete some specific tasks on the website 
				to see if there is any part on the website that made them confused or hard for users to locate the thing they want. It is important because I can see how user interacts 
				with my site to get more knowledge on user experiences. </p>

			<h3> User Test </h3>
			<p> I conducted three different tests including five question test, click test, and question test. The reason I chose click test is I want to test if my buttons and clickable links are visible to users. I used five second test to test the layout of the interface such as color, 
				font, and design. Question test is the most important test that I focus on. I used it to test the functions of the page. The only problem that I faced during testing is I don’t have many responses from users.  </p>

	<h1>Summary of Finding</h1>
	<p>	
		I have a deep understanding of the requirement process in Agile development by doing user research including user interview, competitor analysis, feature user matrix, and feature prioritization. I made the user interview with three different people. They are software engineering, 
		computer science information student and graduated chemistry student, who has no idea of web design. I found out that the software engineer want more features on the website, while others want the website to be simple and concentrate on the design. After the user interview, 
		I have deep understanding on user goals and expectations. By doing a competitor analysis with another portfolio website, I can learn their strength as well as how they implement it to improve my website. I found out that most websites outside the worlds use simple design and light background. 
		Next, I sum up all features that need to be built on my portfolio website into feature matrix list. In the feature matrix list, each feature has its own business value, user value and technical effort. The value is based on the range of one to five. The feature which has the lowest sum up score 
		is the most important one. When doing the feature value, I got lost in deciding the business and user value for each feature. The last step in user research is conducting the feature priority to feature list. So that I can know which one must be implemented first should have more focus on when development.</p>

	<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
	<p>
		During user research, I found out that I should focus mainly on the content. Portfolio website is the place I need to show case my studies and projects, work experiences and my skills, especially on projects section. In the competitor analysis, when looking at my friend’s portfolio website, 
		I did change my layout to have more white space and delete the text shadow because it’s hurt the eyes when the shadow of the text makes users feel the text is jumping around. In addition, I also made change to the content to be displayed at the center of the page on the large screen. User stories 
		help me recognizing that it will be hard for hiring manager or the recruiter to look at my skills because I listed them as the last row in my bio section. Therefore I made them as a list of skills at the bottom of “About” section. Most users don’t like my background image, so I decided to take it out. 
		When doing user testing, I think it would be better if I break the test question into two smaller one because when asking too many question in the test, users will get tired easily.</p>
	<p>
		In the future, I’m planning to make my navigation bar fixed on the screen when scrolling and add some CSS animation. I will also add the project pictures for every projects I posted there. I did some projects when learning new skills online, so I think I need to show case what I learn and how I applied that 
		skill on my personal work. Some new projects will be coming in the future. I think it would benefit me if I can tell more detail on the project process, what challenged I faced during the implementation and how I overcome it.
